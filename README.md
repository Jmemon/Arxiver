Ultimately aiming to be able to give an LLM some information about a research area I'm interested in, have it then search arxiv for
relevant papers, download them, and allow us to ask questions about the topics, write summaries, find connections, find new research directions, and hopefully more.


Version X.Y.Z
Increment Z for minor changes in Arxiver -- Parameter changes. Eg tweak prompt template, more/less context items retrieved.
Increment Y for changes in architecture. Eg Single-query retrieval -> Multi-query retrieval, Incorporate text generation, Change vector DB.
Increment X for substantial change in arch or important step in capability. Eg reliably communicate with a single pdf, reliably communicate with multiple pdfs, Chatbot -> Agent, etc.
